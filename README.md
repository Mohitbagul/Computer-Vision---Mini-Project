# Computer-Vision---Mini-Project


The project focuses on generating realistic building facades using the Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the CMP Facades dataset. It enables the creation of architecturally accurate images from text prompts, allowing users to specify details such as building style, floor count, and window placement. By leveraging advanced AI techniques like noise diffusion and prompt-based generation, the project streamlines architectural visualization, making it accessible and efficient for design applications. The tool provides a scalable solution for creating diverse facade concepts tailored to user requirements.
